This repository contains course materials including code and data.

Please note that all course discussion takes place on a new system called EdStem that you can access from [the course LEARN page](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk).

We have also prepared a [Python introductory mini course](https://github.com/tisimpson/pbi/tree/main/python_basics) in case this is useful to people. This uses Python notebooks that you can use on your local machine if you have Python and Jupyter installed or you can import this GitHub directly into the University's [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/launch) service and run them from there. We will also show you how to woprk with notebooks during the course.

There is a good guide to installing Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Note that materials will be added to this GitHub as the course progresses.
