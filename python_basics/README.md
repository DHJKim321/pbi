## Python Mini-Course

### Welcome

On this page you will find a series of introductory notebooks to help you get started with programming using Python. These were developed by one of the course tutors, Magdalena Navarro and used in our course last year. For some of you these will not contain anything new, but especially for people who are new to Python they are a nice introduction to the main features of the language. In the notebooks you will find commentary guiding you through each section alongside a variety of links to outside resources to further aid your learning. You should use the dedicated Discussion board channel to ask any questions that you have relating to this mini-course.

In many of the notebooks we use the text of Lewis Carrolls' 1865 novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" as a data source to demonstrate some of the features of Python in what is hopefully a fun and engaging way.

As a final note, this mini-course is optional and non-assessed, it is simply there to help you start your journeys to becoming more confident and capable programming in Python. The course does not specifically deal with and Biology oriented material it focusses squarely on developing your knowledge of the language itself.

These were prepared by Dr. Magdalena Navarro when they were supporting teaching on Bio1.
